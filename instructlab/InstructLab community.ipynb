    "\n",
    "https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/FAQ.md\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is LAB?\n",
    "\n",
    "LAB (Large-scale Alignment for chatBots) is a novel synthetic data-based align tuning method for LLMs from IBM Research. It consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A taxonomy-driven data curation process\n",
    "- A large-scale synthetic data generator\n",
    "- Multi-phased-training with replay buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "The LAB approach allows incrementally adding new knowledge and skills to an already pre-trained model without catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What large language models (LLMs) am I contributing to through the InstructLab project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to the InstructLab project fine-tune Merlinite-7b or Granite-7b, an open source licensed LLM. Contributors have direct access to the model they are improving through Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is a “skill”?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of InstructLab, a skill is a capability domain submitted by a contributor intending to train the AI model on the submitted information. In other words, when you submit a skill, you teach the AI model how to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "InstructLab skills are broken down into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Composition skills. Composition or performative skills allow AI models to perform specific tasks or functions. With InstructLab, there are two types of composition skills:\n",
    "  - Freeform compositional skills are performative skills that do not require additional context. For example, to train an AI model to write a poem, you would provide examples of poems.\n",
    "  - Grounded compositional skills are performative skills that require additional context. One example is how an AI model reads the value of a cell in a table layout. To create the grounded skill to read a table formatted in Markdown, the additional context might be an example table layout.\n",
    "- Foundational skills. Foundational skills are skills like math, reasoning, and coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Foundational skills are not currently being accepted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is “knowledge”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge consists of data and facts. When creating knowledge for an AI model, you are providing it with additional data and information to answer questions more accurately. Whereas skills are the information that trains an AI model on how to do something, knowledge is based on the AI model’s ability to answer questions that involve facts, data, or references.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Is the project looking for certain types of skill contributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, InstructLab only accepts compositional (freeform and grounded) skills and knowledge. However, any type of freeform or grounded skill can be submitted. Some skills might not be added to the taxonomy repository for reasons such as duplication, submitting a skill that the model already does well, or submitting a controversial skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundational skills are not currently being accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of accepted skills, see Accepted Skills.\n",

    "https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-with-knowledge-contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "> Do submissions to the project require a contributor license agreement of some kind?\n",
    "\n",
    "The InstructLab project follows the same approach (the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)) that the Linux Kernel community uses to manage code contributions. Unless the file says otherwise for this project, the relevant open source license is the Apache License, Version 2.0. When submitting a patch for review, you must include a sign-off statement in the commit message. See the \"Legal\" section of the Contributing document.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#ways-to-contribute\n",
    "\n",
    "> What happens after you submit a pull request?\n",
    "\n",
    "After a pull request is submitted, a review is conducted by both the Taxonomy Triage team and the Taxonomy Approvers team to ensure that they are relevant, actionable, and have all of the required information needed to be a valuable addition to the AI model. Triagers might provide feedback and use labels to manage the state of the submitted pull request. Triagers also might provide informative feedback and helpful comments to improve the submission. After the pull request is approved, a Taxonomy Approver merges the skill.\n",

    "More information regarding basic review questions, subjective review questions, labels, and the reasons for approval, further review requirements, or rejection can be found on the Triaging contributions page of the GitHub repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "> How are submissions reviewed?\n",
    "\n",
    "For code review, the project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good to Me) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the maintainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For skills and knowledge PRs, your PR will be checked to ensure it is relevant, actionable, and has all the information necessary for the approval team to review and merge the PR. The Triage team will use labels to manage the state and action of PRs as well as provide feedback to contributors based upon the following review guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the PR have the pull request template information filled out?\n",
    "- Did all the PR checks pass?\n",
    "- Does the skill have three or more examples?\n",
    "- Are the YAML fields correct?\n",
    "- No PII in content\n",
    "- Does this content include anything documented in the project's Avoid these Topics guidelines?\n",
    "- Does it adhere to the Code of Conduct guidelines?\n",
    "- Was a response clearly generated by the LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "> How long will it take for my pull request to be reviewed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the large number of contributions currently being received, it is difficult to provide an exact timeline for reviewing your pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If my pull request is accepted, how long will it take for my changes to appear in the next model update?\n",
    "\n",
    "After a pull request is accepted, the changes are regularly incorporated into InstructLab."

    "\n",
    "Skills should seek to add capabilities or a knowledge domain to the AI model; in other words, a skills submission should teach the AI model how to do something instead of providing information about something.

For a list of commonly accepted skills, see Accepted Skills.\n",

    "https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/docs/SKILLS_GUIDE.md#skills-to-avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of skills that we don't expect this procedure to improve. Most skills in these categories will be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math\n",
    "- Real world knowledge-based skills (Unless it can be framed as a \"grounded skill\", where the user is expected to provide context, knowledge contributions will be a separate part of the taxonomy. Skills shouldn't expect the model to come up with its own facts, but instead assemble facts provided.)\n",
    "- Red Teaming: Adversarial questions and answers will be rejected at this time.\n",
    "- Small Ce: hanges to Original Response: If the original LLM response is pretty close, but it's not responding to your exact expectations, a skill is not the right way to solve that problem.\n",

    " - Facts such as, \"Christianity is, according to the 2011 census, the fifth most practiced religion in Nepal, with 375,699 adherents, or 1.4% of the population\", are fine as a knowledge contribution.  \n",
    "  - Advocating in favor of or against any religious faith is not acceptable.\n",

    "- \"Guard Rails\" for AI\n",
    "  - We expect our upstream engineering team to create these types of skills and safe guards. We appreciate our community wanting to help with this, but there are underlying engineering decisions and taking this from the community may conflict with these.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We received so many at the beginning, and with jokes being \"in the eye of the beholder\" and puns requiring nuance for native English speakers, we realized we were possibly unconsciously biasing our model. We have discovered that working with both topics has its own challenges, and if we want something generalized, finding consensus was unsuccessful.\n",

    "Skills in this category are welcomed, as refining these abilities helps us get better at the kinds of tasks where LLMs can excel.\n",

    "\n",
    "Skills in this category are welcomed, since LLM behavior in these sorts of topics are very difficult for the model to get right. Try several examples to understand the nuances of the model's ability to do these sorts of tasks, and consider using corrections to the results you get in your tuning process.\n",
